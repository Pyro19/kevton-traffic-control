The rapid growth in the number of vehicles on the road and the increasing
size of cities have created many problems for road traffic management
authorities, including traffic congestion, accidents, and air pollution. The
existing obsolete traffic management model with a fixed timer for changing the
signal light is inefficient in managing the current level of high-value road
traffic. Along with this obsolete system, the issue of the rising number of road
accidents, and irresponsible citizensâ€™ action of wrong lane driving is increasing
the concern of the authorities as well as the common citizen to improve the road
traffic security and improve the traffic management efficiency.
